# Churn-Prediction-project

Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn, which refers to the likelihood of customers discontinuing their service or subscription. Understanding and predicting churn is crucial for businesses aiming to retain customers and enhance customer satisfaction.

Objective:
The main goal of this project was to build a predictive model that identifies customers who are at high risk of churning. By predicting churn, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies and improve customer loyalty.

Approach:
Data Collection and Preparation:

Data Source: Utilized customer data from sources such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems or public datasets like the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
Features: Included customer attributes such as age, tenure, service usage patterns, contract type, and payment methods.
Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, outliers, and performed normalization or standardization of features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted EDA to understand the distribution and relationships of features related to customer churn.
Visualized key metrics and churn patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify significant predictors of churn.
Feature Engineering:

Created new features or transformed existing ones to improve model performance, such as customer tenure, monthly charges, and total spent.
Applied feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant predictors of churn.
Model Development:

Implemented various machine learning algorithms for classification, including:
Logistic Regression: To establish a baseline model for predicting churn probability.
Decision Trees: For capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
Random Forest: For enhancing model accuracy through ensemble learning.
Gradient Boosting: To improve prediction performance by combining multiple weak models.
Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Model Evaluation:

Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Conducted cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.
Results and Insights:

Analyzed model results to determine the factors most strongly associated with customer churn.
Provided actionable insights and recommendations for retention strategies based on the modelâ€™s findings.
Visualization and Reporting:

Created visualizations to present churn prediction results, including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance charts.
Documented findings and recommendations in a comprehensive report to guide business decisions and retention efforts.
Tools and Libraries Used:
Python: The programming language used for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating visualizations.
This project highlights the application of machine learning techniques for predicting customer churn, demonstrating the ability to leverage data to improve customer retention strategies. It underscores the importance of data preparation, feature engineering, and model evaluation in developing effective predictive models.
